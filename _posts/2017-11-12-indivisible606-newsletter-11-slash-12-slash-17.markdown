 Actions & Events 

Taxes

    NEW! Call Rauner (217-782-0244) and ask him to public opposed the repub tax reform bill that will hurt IL residents.

    No other new actions to do here yet, but be ready for action as the Repubs ramp up their efforts to jam this windfall for the rich through congress. 

    If you haven’t yet - Call Durbin (202-224-2152) and Duckworth (202-224-2854) and let them know that you are AGAINST Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy! Trickle down economics is a proven failure and hurts everyone but the rich. 

Federal Judges Confirmations

    NEW! Call Call Durbin (202-224-2152) and Duckworth (202-224-2854) and tell them you oppose any nomination for federal judge not given a “Well Qualified” rating by the American Bar Association’s Committee on Federal Judiciary. Trump has nominated - and the Senate has approved - more fed judges than any other recent President. Many of them are bigots and misogynists. Several are unqualified!

Basic Democracy

    NEW! This Wednesday, attend the IL State Senate Telecomm and Infotech Committee meeting to hear what the IL State Board of Elections has to say to try to justify continued participation in the discriminatory and unsecure voter CrossCheck program. Open to the public. ID required for entry. 11/15, 160 N. LaSalle, 6th floor committee room.

    NEW! IL state senate hopefuls must secure enough signatures to petition for candidacy by Dec. 4th. Find a candidate that you like and sign his/her/their petition if needed.

Healthcare

    ACA open enrollment is NOW! Print out & post the flyers at this link: http://www.upstreamhealth.org/content/documents/oe5_flyer_-_eng_spa.pdf 

    ACA Consumer Advocacy has resources and action opportunities. Check them out here: https://www.facebook.com/acaconsumer/

    Call Durbin (202-224-2152) and Duckworth (202-224-2854) and thank them for fighting for renewal of CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program). Ask them to fight against any ultimatum that exchanges funding for tax cuts for the wealthiest citizens.

    Republicans have defunded the infrastructure of ACA, drastically reducing advertising coverage and taking healthcare.gov down at crucial times during the week. Spread the word on social media and point people in the right direction here: https://getamericacovered.org/

Guns

    NEW! Ask your Durbin (202-224-2152) and Duckworth (202-224-2854) to OPPOSE Senate Bill 446 - a bill that would allow persons from states allowing concealed carry of guns to carry in states that do not allow it. (States’ rights, indeed!)

    Continue to call your senators and representatives and demand they support gun law reform that will put us on the path to a safer country.

Chicago Action (Optional/Chicago residents)

    If you haven't yet...Call your representative in the House ( https://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ ) and urge them to support House Bill 1774, which will require an elected school board for Chicago. This is the first step toward reversing the illegal cuts to special education that were recently exposed.
